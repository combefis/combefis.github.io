# Python Programming

The _“B103B – Programmation”_ activity is part of the _“B2010 – Informatique”_ course taught to first year bachelor students in engineering at the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM). The _“B2010 – Informatique”_ course is taught to second year bachelor students in engineering and the _“B2160 – Projet informatique”_ course is taught to second year of bachelor in electronics and computer science engineering, both in the same school. All the three are about **Python programming**. In addition to the programming language, advanced computer science concepts are covered, such as file system manipulation, the operation of internet, web development, project management, artificial intelligence and the manipulation of documents.

## Course organisation

I designed these courses in 2014 with my colleague Quentin Lurkin and was involved in some of their activities from 2014 to 2019, for six times. The activities are taught in French, but the material created for them are either in English or [in French](/fr/teaching/ecam/python/).

The courses were given in a traditional way with lecture sessions, lab sessions and small projects students had to work on.
