    <p>I worked as a full-time <b>lecturer</b> at the <a href="https://www.ecam.be">ECAM Brussels Engineering School</a> (ECAM), an higher education institution, for six years (2014–2020). I was involved in several courses targeted to bachelor and master students, in particular for future engineers in computer science. Since 2018, I also gave some courses to business analyst master students, an course program co-organised with the <a href="https://www.ichec.be/?kb_lang=english">ICHEC Brussels Management School</a> (ICHEC).</p>

    <p>Many courses at ECAM are managed by a team of teachers, and only those in which I was involved are mentioned hereafter. More details with resources for some courses are available on subsequent pages.</p>
