# Word Prediction with N-Grams Model Using Python

The “AI611µ Word Prediction with N-Grams Model using Python” micro-course is about how to perform **word prediction** with artificial intelligence techniques. More precisely, it presents how to use **N-Grams model** to predict words based on a corpus and builds a small example with Python.

I gave this micro-course in 2020, once, at the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM) as a part of the [“I4110 – Artificial intelligence” course](../../ecam/ai/). The course is taught in French, but all the material is available in English and in French.
