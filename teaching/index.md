    <p>I work as a <em>lecturer</em> at the
    <a href="https://www.ecam.be">ECAM Brussels Engineering School</a> (ECAM)
    and also at the <a href="http://www.itscm2.be"> Institut Technique
    Supérieur Cardinal Mercier</a> (ITSCM) where I am <b>teaching computer
    science</b> related courses.</p>

    <p>Prior to my current position, I worked as a <em>teaching assistant</em>
    at the <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en">Université catholique de
    Louvain</a> (UCLouvain) for the
    <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/ingi">
    Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> (INGI). I supervised
    several courses each year, which consisted in lab sessions preparation and
    mentoring. Courses for first year bachelor students were given in French
    while those for master students were in English. I also supervised several
    master thesis at UCLouvain.</p>

    <p>In addition to my main activities, I also gave <b>trainings and
    conferences</b> about various subjects mainly related to computer science,
    project management, efficient communication and other sciences. Finally, I
    am involved in several <b>pedagogical projects</b> including the
    development of educational devices to improve the success rate for first
    year bachelor students.</p>
