# Research

I worked as a part-time _senior researcher_ at the [Centre de Recherche et de Développement de l'ECAM](https://www.cerdecam.be) (CERDECAM) for a little over two and a half years, from 2018 to 2020. In this research centre, associated to the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM), I mainly worked on **data analysis**.

I got my PhD in November 2013 from the [Université catholique de Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) (UCLouvain). My **PhD thesis**, under the supervision of Prof. Dr Charles Pecheur, is about the analysis of _human-machine interaction using formal methods_. More precisely, by modelling systems using enriched Labelled Transition Systems, we generate abstractions, called mental models, that allow the operators of the systems to control them in a proper way.

I am also interested in pedagogy and **computer science education**. In 2014, I completed an _advanced master_ on pedagogy in higher education, with a master thesis studying the motivation and success rate of first year bachelor students in computer science. Finally, I also do research on my personal time, on topics related to the various positions I hold and the projects I am leading.
