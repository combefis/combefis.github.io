# PhD Thesis

This section of the website gathers several resources related to the research I worked on for my PhD thesis. This latter is about **formal analysis of human-machine interactions**, a very broad subject.More precisely, this section contains a simplified and vulgarised description of my work, material used during several seminars, the tools developed during my thesis, and many other things.

I started this PhD thesis in January 2008 in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/ingi) (INGI) which is part of the [Institute for Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam) (ICTEAM), under the supervision of Prof. Charles Pecheur. I obtained my Phd thesis graduating from the [Universit√© catholique de Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) in November 2013.
