# Research

XXX

    <p>I worked a little over two and a half year as a part-time <em>senior researcher</em> at the <a href="https://cerdecam.jimdofree.com">CERDECAM</a>, the research center associated to the <a href="https://www.ecam.be">ECAM Brussels Engineering School</a> (ECAM), where I mainly worked on <b>data analysis</b> in the frame of the Egonet project.</p>

    <p>I got my PhD in November 2013 from the <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en/">Universit√© catholique de Louvain</a> (UCLouvain), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Charles Pecheur. My PhD thesis is about the analysis of <em>human-machine interaction using formal methods</em>. More precisely, by modelling systems using enriched Labelled Transition Systems, we generate abstractions of these systems, called mental models, to allow their operators to control them in a proper way.</p>

    <p>I am also interested in pedagogy and <b>computer science education</b>. I completed an <em>advanced master</em> in pedagogy in higher education, with a master thesis studying the motivation and success rate of first year bachelor students in computer science. Finally, I am also interested in the promotion of computer science and technology to secondary school pupils. I am involved in several projects related to these two last subjects, mainly collaborating with the <a href="https://www.csited.be">Computer Science and IT in Education</a> (CSITEd) nonprofit organisation.</p>
