    <p>I work as a <em>lecturer</em> at the
    <a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">École Centrale des Arts et
    Métiers</a> (ECAM) and also at the
    <a href="http://www.cardinalmercier-promotionsociale.be/">
    Institut Technique Supérieur Cardinal Mercier</a> (ITSCM) where I am
    teaching computer science related courses.</p>

    <p>Prior to my current position, I worked as a <em>teaching assistant</em>
    at the <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-index.html">Université
    catholique de Louvain</a> (UCL) for the
    <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-ingi.html">Computer Science and
    Engineering Department</a> (INGI). I supervised several courses each year,
    which consisted in lab sessions preparation and mentoring. Courses for first
    year bachelor students were given in French while those for master students
    were given in English. I also supervised several master thesis at UCL.</p>

    <p>In addition to my main activities, I also gave trainings and conferences
    about various subjects mainly related to computer science, project
    management, efficient communication and other sciences. Finally, I am involved in several pedagogical projects including the
    development of educational devices to improve the success rate for first
    year bachelor students.</p>
