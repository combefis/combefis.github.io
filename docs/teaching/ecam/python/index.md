# Python Programming

XXX

    <p>The <i>« B103B Programmation »</i> activity, taught to first year
    bachelor students in engineering, the <i>« B201A Concepts
    informatiques »</i>, taught to second year bachelor students in engineering
    and the <i>« B216A Développement informatique »</i> activity, taught to
    students in second year of bachelor in electronics and computer science
    engineering at the <a href="https://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">ECAM Brussels
    Engineering School</a> (ECAM), is about <b>Python programming</b>. In
    addition to the programming language, the course introduces to computer
    science concepts such as the file system, the operation of internet, the
    web development, the project management, the artificial intelligence and
    the manipulation of documents.</p>

    <p>I started to give this course in 2014 with my colleague Quentin Lurkin,
    until 2017, that is for four years. Since 2018, I still manage a few
    laboratory sessions, for the second time. The course is taught in French,
    but all the material is available in English and
    <a href="/fr/teaching/ecam/python/">in French</a>.</p>
