I am working since 2022 as a **lecturer** at the [Haute École Provinciale de Hainaut](https://www.condorcet.be) (HEPH - Condorcet), a higher education institution. My current role in this school is to teach one course for students of the specialisation bachelor in computer system and network security. The course is taught in French, but some resources are only provided in English.
