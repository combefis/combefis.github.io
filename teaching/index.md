<p>I work as a <em>lecturer</em> at the
<a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">École Centrale des Arts et Métiers</a>
(ECAM) and also at the
<a href="http://www.cardinalmercier-promotionsociale.be/spip2012/index.php">
Institut Technique Supérieur Cardinal Mercier</a> (ITSCM) where I am teaching
computer science related courses.</p>

<p>Prior to my current position, I worked as a <em>teaching assistant</em> at
the <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-index.html">Université catholique de
Louvain</a> (UCL) for the <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-ingi.html">
Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> (INGI). I supervised several
courses each year, that is, preparing and giving lab sessions. Courses for
first year bachelor students were given in French while those for master
students were given in English. I also supervised several master thesis for the
UCL, and interns for the ECAM.</p>

<p>In addition to my main activities, I also gave trainings on Java™ for second
year bachelor students for their programming project course. I also give other
trainings, for the <a href="http://uclouvain.acm-sc.be/">UCLouvain ACM Student
Chapter</a> non-profit association, for example.</p>

<p>Finally, I am involved in several pedagogical projects including the
development of educational devices to improve the success rate for first year
bachelor students.</p>
