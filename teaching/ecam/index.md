    <p>I currently work as a <b>lecturer</b> at the
    <a href="https://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">ECAM Brussels Engineering
    School</a> (ECAM), an industrial higher education institution. I am
    involved in several courses targeted to bachelor and master students,
    in particular for future engineers in computer science and electronics.
    I am teaching at ECAM for five years now (2014–2019). Since 2018, I also
    give some courses to business analyst  master students, an alternating
    course program co-organised with the
    <a href="https://www.ichec.be/?kb_lang=english">ICHEC Brussels Management
    School</a> (ICHEC).</p>

    <p>Several courses are managed by a team of teachers, and only the
    activities I am involved in are mentioned hereafter. More details with
    resources for some courses are available on subsequent pages.</p>
