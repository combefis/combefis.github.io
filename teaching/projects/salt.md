    <p>The <b>SAlt project</b> has been created in September 2014 and launched during the first semester of the 2014-2015 academic year at the <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en">Université catholique de Louvain</a> (UCLouvain) for second year bachelor students in computer science. I worked on this project, and put in place the developed pedagogical device, with the collaboration of Chantal Poncin, the computer science program advisor, and three repeating students.</p>

    <p>The goal of the project is to design an educational device to <b>help students working on and studying</b> three courses that are known to be very difficult to them. A special week during the first semester is dedicated to such remediation activities. The activities proposed by this project took place during this special week, called “<i><b>S</b>emaine <b>Alt</b>ernative</i>”, from which the project name comes from. The project has been pursued for one year but is not discontinued, mainly due to a lack of human resources and the removal of the special remediation week.</p>
