    <p>I work as a <em>lecturer</em> at the
    <a href="https://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">ECAM Brussels Engineering
    School</a> (ECAM) and also at the
    <a href="https://www.cardinalmercier-promotionsociale.be">
    Institut Technique Supérieur Cardinal Mercier</a> (ITSCM) where I am
    <b>teaching computer science</b> related courses.</p>

    <p>Prior to my current position, I worked as a <em>teaching assistant</em>
    at the <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en">Université
    catholique de Louvain</a> (UCLouvain) for the
    <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/ingi">
    Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> (INGI). I supervised
    several courses each year, which consisted in lab sessions preparation and
    mentoring. Courses for first year bachelor students were given in French
    while those for master students were in English. I also supervised several
    master thesis at UCLouvain.</p>

    <p>In addition to my main activities, I also gave <b>trainings and
    conferences</b> about various subjects mainly related to computer science,
    project management, efficient communication and other sciences. Finally, I
    am involved in several <b>pedagogical projects</b> including the
    development of educational devices to improve the success rate for first
