    <p>I have the opportunity to frequently give <b>conferences and
    trainings</b> on several subjects. This section of the website gathers all
    the material that I built for those trainings. For some of them, code
    examples had been presented and are also available for download.</p>

    <p>I gave those trainings mainly for the
    <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en">Universit√© catholique de
    Louvain</a> (UCLouvain), for the <i>UCLouvain ACM Student Chapter ASBL</i>,

    <a href="https://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ipl">Institut Paul Lambin</a> (IPL).</p>

    <p>If you have any interest for a conference by me, please
    <a href="/about/">contact me</a>.</p>
