# LADO

The **LADO project** aims at the design of learning materials to learn and teach algorithm design and optimisation using contest tasks. Students working as a group, supervised by a coach-professor, will work together and cooperate through a GitHub repository, to produce learning materials based on existing contest tasks. This material can then be used to support the **learning of algorithm design and optimisation** in programming courses for higher education or it can also be used for self-learning.

The project should have taken place during the 2017-2018 academic year at the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM), but has been delayed to a near future, hopefully.
