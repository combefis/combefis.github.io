    <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome on my personal homepage!</p>
    
    <p>I am currently working as a <em>lecturer</em> at
    <a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">École Centrale des Arts et
    Métiers</a> (ECAM), a higher education institution which trains future
    engineers. More precisely, I am in the <em>Electronics and IT Unit</em>.</p>
    
    <p>I got a <em>PhD in Engineering</em> in November 2013 from the
    <a href="http://uclouvain.be/en-index.html">Université catholique de
    Louvain</a> (UCL). My thesis is about applying formal method techniques to
    the analysis of human-machine interactions. I also got a <em>Master in
    Computer Science Engineering</em> degree from the
    <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/epl">Louvain School of Engineering</a>
    (EPL) and an <em>Advanced Master in Pedagogy in Higher Education</em>, both
    from the same university.</p>
    
    <p>I am also interested in <em>teaching and promoting computer
    science</em>. I am one of the founder of the
    <a href="http://www.be-oi.be/fr/">Belgian Olympiad in Informatics</a>,
    a contest about programming, algorithmic and logic. I am also the President
    of <a href="http://www.csited.be/home">CSITEd</a>, a non-profit
    organisation whose goal is to promote informatics, in particular to
    secondary schools pupils. It is under that organisation that I am one of
    the belgian representatives for the
    <a href="http://www.bebras.be/en/home">Bebras contest</a>.</p>
