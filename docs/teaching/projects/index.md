# Projects

I designed and put in place several pedagogical devices  related to teaching, developed as projects. These latter are related to the **efficient teaching of sciences**, in particular computer science. Some projects are also related to the improvement of the **success rate of students**. Finally, some of them are dedicated to teaching in special conditions or for a particular public such as young people who dropped out of school, for example.

This section of the website desribes the different projects. It also gathers resources related to the project as well as teaching and learning materials that have been developed.
