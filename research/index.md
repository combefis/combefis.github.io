    <p>I got my PhD in November 2013 from the
    <a href="http://uclouvain.be/en-index.html">Universit√© catholique de
    Louvain</a> (UCL). I worked for the <a href="http://lvl.info.ucl.ac.be/">
    Louvain Verification Lab</a> (LVL) under the supervision of Prof. Charles
    Pecheur. My PhD thesis is about the study of <em>human-machine interaction
    using formal methods</em>. More precisely, by modelling systems using
    enriched LTS (Labelled Transition Systems), we generate abstractions of
    those systems, called mental models, which allows an operator to control
    the system in a proper way.</p>
    
    <p>I am also interested in pedagogy, in particular for higher education. I
    completed an <em>advanced master</em> in that domain and my master thesis is
    about motivational and success rate for first bachelor students in computer
    science. Finally, I am also interested in the promotion of computer science
    and technology to secondary school pupils. I am involved in several projects
    concerning those two last subjects, mainly collaborating with the
    <a href="http://www.csited.be/home">Computer Science and IT in Education
    ASBL</a> (CSITEd) and with the
    <a href="http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml">International Olympiad
    in Informatics</a> (IOI) community.</p>
