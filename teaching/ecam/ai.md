    <p>The <i>« I4110 – Artificial Intelligence »</i> course, taught to
    first year master students in computer science industrial engineer and in 
    electronics at the <a href="https://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">ECAM Brussels
    Engineering School</a> (ECAM), is about <b>artificial intelligence and
    machine learning</b>. The course begins by explaining the principle of a
    search problem and how they can be solved with general algorithms. It then
    presents other techniques related to more specific fields such as logic
    reasoning, constraint programming, swarm intelligence, natural language
    processing and deep learning.</p>

    <p>I started to give this course in 2018 and I am currently giving it for
    the third time. The machine learning part is given by my colleague Ruben
    Hillewaere, with a focus on mathematical aspects. The course is taught in
    English, but all the material is available in English and
    <a href="/fr/teaching/ecam/ai/">in French</a>.</p>
