# ITSCM

I am working since 2011 as a **technical course professor** at the [Institut Technique Supérieur Cardinal Mercier](https://www.itscm.be) (ITSCM), a higher further education institution. My current role in this school is to teach one course for students of the bachelor in informatics and systems and the bachelor in electronics.
