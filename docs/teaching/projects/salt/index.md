# SAlt

The **SAlt project** has been created in September 2014 and launched during the first semester of the 2014-2015 academic year at the [Université catholique de Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) (UCLouvain) for second year bachelor students in computer science. I worked on this project, and put in place the developed pedagogical device, with the collaboration of Chantal Poncin, the computer science program advisor, and three repeating students.

The goal of the project is to design an educational device to **help students working on and studying** three courses that are known to be very difficult to them. A special week during the first semester is dedicated to such remediation activities. The activities proposed by this project took place during this special week, called “_**S**emaine **Alt**ernative_”, from which the project name comes from.

The project has been pursued for one year but is now discontinued, mainly due to a lack of human resources and the removal of the special remediation week.
