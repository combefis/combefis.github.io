# Teaching

I currently work as a part-time _technical course professor_ at the [Institut Technique Supérieur Cardinal Mercier](https://www.itscm.be) (ITSCM) and as a part-time _lecturer_ both at the [EPHEC](https://www.ephec.be) and [Haute École Provinciale de Hainaut](https://www.condorcet.be) (HEPH-Condorcet), where I mainly teach **computer science** related courses.

In the past, I worked as a full-time _lecturer_ at the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM) from 2014 to 2020 and as a full-time _teaching assistant_ at the [Université catholique de Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) (UCLouvain) from 2007 to 2013. I mainly gave lectures, supervised lab sessions and mentored students. I also supervised several **internships and master thesis** when I had these positions.

Finally, I also gave **trainings and conferences** about various subjects, mainly related to computer science, project management and efficient communication. I am also involved in several **pedagogical projects**, including the development of educational devices to improve the success rate of students, in particular for newcomers.
