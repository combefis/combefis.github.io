# Internships

When I was a **lecturer** at the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM) from 2014 to 2020, I had the opportunity to be involved in [internships supervision](./supervision/). Students had to find an internship in a company for at least six weeks, twice during their studies.

The first internship took place during the third bachelor year. It was an **immersion internship** whose main goals were to discover the life in a company, its organisation, and the everyday work of an engineer and to participate to concrete projects led by employees from the company. The second internship took place during the second master year. It was a **work placement internship** whose main goals were to manage an industrial project and to actively participate to it within a company team. My role was to ensure, with the company, that the internship was going well, to attend to the final defense and to participate to the evaluation of the student.

I was also involved in the supervision of internships that took place within ECAM with external students from other institutions working on several [internal projects](./projects/). These interns usually came from [Haute École Léonard de Vinci](https://www.vinci.be/en) (HE Vinci) or [Haute École EPHEC](https://www.ephec.be) (EPHEC). I also started to supervise internships within [EDITx](https://editx.eu/en), working on projects related to its business.
