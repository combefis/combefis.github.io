    <p>Every year, I have the opportunity to be involved in several
    <a href="/teaching/internships/supervision/">internship supervisions</a>.
    ECAM students have to find an internship in a firm for at least six weeks,
    twice during their studies. The first internship takes place during the
    third year of bachelor. It is an immersion stage whose main goals are to
    discover the life in a firm, its organisation, and the everyday work of an
    engineer and to participate to concrete projects lead by people from the
    firm. The second internship takes place during the second year of master,
    just before the students hopefully get their degree. It is a work placement
    internship whose main goal is to manage an industrial project and actively
    participate to it within a team from the firm. My role is to ensure, with
    the firm, that the internship is going well and to attend to the final
    defense and participate to the evaluation of the student.</p>

    <p>I am also involved in the supervision of internships that take place
    within ECAM with external students from other institutions working on
    several internal <a href="/teaching/internships/projects/">projects</a>.
    These interns typically come from
    <a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ipl">Institut Paul Lambin</a> (IPL) or
    <a href="http://www.ephec.be/">École Pratique des Hautes Études
    Commerciales</a> (EPHEC).</p>
