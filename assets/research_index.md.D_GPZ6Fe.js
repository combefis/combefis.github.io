In this research centre, associated to the <a href="https://www.ecam.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ECAM Brussels Engineering School</a> (ECAM), I mainly worked on <strong>data analysis</strong>.</p><p>I got my PhD in November 2013 from the <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Université catholique de Louvain</a> (UCLouvain). My <strong>PhD thesis</strong>, under the supervision of Prof. Dr Charles Pecheur, is about the analysis of <em>human-machine interaction using formal methods</em>. More precisely, by modelling systems using enriched Labelled Transition Systems, we generate abstractions, called mental models, that allow the operators of the systems to control them in a proper way.</p><p>I am also interested in pedagogy and <strong>computer science education</strong>. In 2014, I completed an <em>advanced master</em> on pedagogy in higher education, with a master thesis studying the motivation and success rate of first year bachelor students in computer science. Finally, I also do research on my personal time, on topics related to the various positions I hold and the projects I am leading.</p>',4)]))}const u=a(o,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,u as default};
