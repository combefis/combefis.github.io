    <p>I worked from 2007 to 2013 as a <b>teaching assistant</b> for the
    <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en">Université catholique de Louvain</a>
    (UCLouvain). My role was to prepare and give practical lab sessions to
    bachelor and master students, for several courses, either in French or in
    English. I started to be involved in the <i>« Informatique 1 »</i> course
    in 2004 as a teaching monitor (tutor) while I was still studying.</p>

    <p>After I got my PhD, I was also responsible for two courses as an
    <b>invited lecturer</b>, from 2014 to 2016. I taught the
    <i>« Informatique 1 »</i> first year bachelor course to more than 400
    students and the <i>« Software Engineering Project »</i> course targeted to
    master students.</p>
