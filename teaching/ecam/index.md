    <p>I currently work as a lecturer at the
    <a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">École Centrale des Arts et
    Métiers</a> (ECAM), an industrial higher education institution. I am
    involved in several courses of the bachelor and the master, in particular
    for the future industrial engineers in electronics and computer science.</p>

    <p>You can find the list of courses that I am currently teaching, and that
    I taught in the past, hereafter, along with the level of students attending
    the course and a short description of it. For each course, only the
    activities I am involved in are mentioned. More details with resources for
    some courses are available on subsequent pages.</p>
