It was an <strong>immersion internship</strong> whose main goals were to discover the life in a company, its organisation, and the everyday work of an engineer and to participate to concrete projects led by employees from the company. The second internship took place during the second master year. It was a <strong>work placement internship</strong> whose main goals were to manage an industrial project and to actively participate to it within a company team. My role was to ensure, with the company, that the internship was going well, to attend to the final defense and to participate to the evaluation of the student.</p><p>I was also involved in the supervision of internships that took place within ECAM with external students from other institutions working on several <a href="./projects/">internal projects</a>.
