# NoSQL

The “I404C NoSQL” activity is part of the “I4040 – Database Management System” course taught to students of first year master in computer science industrial engineer at the [ECAM Brussels Engineering School](https://www.ecam.be) (ECAM). This activity is about **NoSQL models and databases** and, in addition to presenting the four main models, it covers NoSQL specific characteristics and properties.

## Course organisation

I gave this activity from 2016 to 2019, for four times. The activity was taught in French, but the material created for it are either in English or [in French](/fr/teaching/ecam/nosql/).

Originally, the activity was given in a traditional way with ten lecture sessions and a small project students had to work on. In 2019, I began transforming the activity following the [competency based assessment approach](/teaching/projects/tlca/) that I started to develop that year.

- Session 6: Interfacing with a NoSQL Engine
- Session 7: Data Consistency
- Session 8: Operations on Data with NoSQL
- Session 9: Deploying a NoSQL Database
- Session 10: Beyond NoSQL

## Practice
