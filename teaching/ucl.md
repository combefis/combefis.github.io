    <p>This page of the website lists the courses I had to train for my
    teaching assistant duties at
    <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-index.html">Université catholique de
    Louvain</a> (UCL). My role was to prepare and give practical sessions to
    the students.</p>

    <p>You can find that list hereafter, along with the years I trained the
    courses, the level of students attending the course and a short description
    of the course. I started to train the <i>« Informatique 1 »</i> course as a
    teaching monitor (tutor) while I was still studying.</p>

          in engineering, teaches them the basics of object oriented
          programming, using the Java programming language. Students are
          discovering notions of programming, objects, classes, arrays,

          in computer science, teaches them the basics of algorithmic and
          programming, mainly using the Java programming language. Students are

          in computer science engineering and in computer science, is about the
          theory of concurrent systems. They are teached how to model such
          systems and how to make analysis (deadlock, reachability, safety and
          liveness properties). Students have to realise three small projects
          with LTS models (LTSA) and petri nets (pipe).</i></small></p>

          theory of automata, languages and compilation. Students have to
          realise a project which consists in the development of a compiler or
          interpreter for a language that they define, using a LL(1) or WP
          syntactic analyser. They have to use the Java programming language
          for the project.</i></small></p>

          about common data structures (queues, stacks, heaps, trees, graphs),
          how to implement them, and algorithms to update and do computation
          with those data structures. Students have to realise small projects

          about the basics of bioinformatics, as well biology as informatics
          parts. In informatics, they are discovering sequence alignment
          algorithms and clustering algorithms for phylogenetics. Students have

          bachelor in computer science, is about the development of a software
          project. The resolution of the problem they are given is split into
          three phases. Students are less guided as the project advances. For
          example, they have to develop an application to manage a library
          (managing the list of books and clients, the borrowing and
          reservation process). The language used is Java.</i></small></p>
