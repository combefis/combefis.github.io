    <p>The <b>SAlt project</b> has been created in September 2014 and launched
    during the first semester of the 2014-2015 academic year at the
    <a href="https://www.uclouvain.be/en/">Université
    catholique de Louvain</a> (UCL) for second year bachelor students in
    computer science. I designed and put it in place with the collaboration of
    three students.</p>
    
    <p>The goal of the project was to design an educational device to help
    students working on and studying three courses that are known to be very
    difficult to them. A special week during the first semester is dedicated
    to such remediation activities. The activities proposed by this project
    took place during this special week, called <i><b>S</b>emaine
    <b>Alt</b>ernative</i>, from which the project name comes from.</p>
