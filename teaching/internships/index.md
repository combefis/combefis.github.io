    <p>Every year, I have the opportunity to be involved in several
    <a href="/teaching/internships/supervision/">internship supervisions</a>.
    ECAM students have to find an internship in a company for at least six
    weeks, twice during their studies. The first internship takes place during
    the third bachelor year. It is an <b>immersion internship</b> whose main
    goals are to discover the life in a company, its organisation, and the
    everyday work of an engineer and to participate to concrete projects led by
    employees from the company. The second internship takes place during the
    second master year, just before the students hopefully get their degree. It
    is a <b>work placement internship</b> whose main goal is to manage an
    industrial project and actively participate to it within a company team. My
    role is to ensure, with the company, that the internship is going well and
    to attend to the final defense and participate to the evaluation of the
    student.</p>

    <p>I am also involved in the supervision of internships that take place
    within ECAM with external students from other institutions working on
    several <a href="/teaching/internships/projects/">internal projects</a>,.
    These interns typically come from
    <a href="https://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ipl">Institut Paul Lambin</a> (IPL) or
    <a href="https://www.ephec.be">École Pratique des Hautes Études
    Commerciales</a> (EPHEC). I also started to supervise internships within
    EDITx, recently, working on projects related to its business.</p>
