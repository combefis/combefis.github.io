    <p>I work as a <em>lecturer</em> at the
    <a href="http://www.vinci.be/fr-be/ecam">École Centrale des Arts et
    Métiers</a> (ECAM) and also at the
    <a href="http://www.cardinalmercier-promotionsociale.be/spip2012/index.php">
    Institut Technique Supérieur Cardinal Mercier</a> (ITSCM) where I am
    teaching computer science related courses.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to my current position, I worked as a <em>teaching assistant</em>
    at the <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-index.html">Université
    catholique de Louvain</a> (UCL) for the
    <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/en-ingi.html">Computer Science and
    Engineering Department</a> (INGI). I supervised several courses each year,
    that is, preparing and giving lab sessions. Courses for first year bachelor
    students were given in French while those for master students were given in
    English. I also supervised several master thesis for the UCL, and interns
    for the ECAM.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to my main activities, I also gave trainings on Java™ for
    second year bachelor students for their programming project course. I also
    give other trainings, for the <a href="http://uclouvain.acm-sc.be/">
    UCLouvain ACM Student Chapter</a> non-profit association, for example.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, I am involved in several pedagogical projects including the
    development of educational devices to improve the success rate for first
    year bachelor students.</p>
