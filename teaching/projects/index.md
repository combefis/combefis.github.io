    <p>I designed and put in place several projects and pedagogical devices 
    related to teaching. These projects are related to the <b>efficient teaching
    of sciences</b>, in particular computer science. Some projects are also
    related to the improvement of the <b>success rate of students</b>. Finally,
    some projects are dedicated to teaching in special conditions or for a
    particular public such as young people who dropped out of school.</p>
